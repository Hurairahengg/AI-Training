 This is where i traned Llama3  models using HuggingFace Autotrain. 
## Instructions:



- First in the terminal export you huggingface token:

```export HF_TOKEN=xxx{yourtokenhere}xxx```

- Next, make sure you have all the hugging face repos installed:

- Lastly in the same terminal, do:

```autotrain app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000```

- Now just go to localhost then you should see the Autotrain page and the rest is self explanatory
